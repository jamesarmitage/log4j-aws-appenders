<p> This package exists to allow retrieval of information from AWS using
    service clients other than the main "logging" clients.
<p> In many cases, these alternate clients are found in optional libraries,
    (such as IAM), and we don't want to establish hard dependencies on those
    libraries. The solution is to perform retrievals using reflection, with
    the retriever classes based on {@link AbstractReflectionBasedRetriever}.
<p> Typically you will create a single retriever for a single retrieval.
    Retrieval is a potentially long-running operation, so the results should
    be cached.
<p> There isn't (at this time) a <code>Retriever</code> interface. Maybe in
    the future I'll adopt a more "DI" approach to using them.
